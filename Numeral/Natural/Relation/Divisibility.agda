-- Divisibility relation of natural numbers.
-- `(y ∣ x)` means that `y` is divisible by `x`.
-- In other words: `x/y` is an integer.
-- Or: `∃(c: ℕ). x = c⋅y`.
-- Note on the definition of Div𝐒:
--   The order (y + x) works and depends on rewriting rules of ℕ at the moment (Specifically on the commuted identity and successor rules, I think).
--   Without rewriting rules, deconstruction of Div𝐒 seems not working.
--   Example:
--     div23 : ¬(2 ∣ 3)
--     div23(Div𝐒())
--     This is a "valid" proof, but would not type-check because deconstruction from (2 ∣ 3) to (2 ∣ 1) is impossible.
--     Seems like the compiler would see (3 = 2+x), but because of definition of (_+_), only (3 = x+2) can be found.
--   Defining Div𝐒 with (x + y) inside would work, but then the definition of DivN becomes more complicated because (_⋅_) is defined in this order.
-- Note on zero divisors:
--   (0 ∣ 0) is true, and it is the only number divisible by 0.
data _∣_ : ℕ → ℕ → Stmt{Lvl.𝟎} where
  instance Div𝟎 : ∀{y}   → (y ∣ 𝟎)
  Div𝐒 : ∀{y x} → (y ∣ x) → (y ∣ (y + x))

_∤_ : ℕ → ℕ → Stmt
y ∤ x = ¬(y ∣ x)

-- `Divisor(n)(d)` means that `d` is a divisor of `n`.
Divisor = swap _∣_
